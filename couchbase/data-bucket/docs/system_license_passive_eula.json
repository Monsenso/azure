THE PURPOSE OF THE COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA</h3>\n\n<p>Monsenso uses the Personal Data that you provide in compliance with these privacy rules. Monsenso may therefore use the Personal Data within the context of this document, and in particular without restriction in the following contexts:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Supply of the Monsenso Service:</strong>Monsenso will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to and use of the Monsenso Service. This includes engaging Individuals in self-care, engaging Carers in informal care to support Individuals,&nbsp;and giving Care Providers a remote monitoring tool to make better&nbsp;clinical decisions. Processing of Personal Data for this purpose is necessary for the performance of the Monsenso Service.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To produce statistics and/or aggregated data analyses:</strong>Monsenso firmly believes that data can serve the collective interest. Therefore, statistics and analyses using collected data may be produced. Personal Data will be anonymised through generalisation before data processing to assure your privacy to be protected. Data is used in particular to: (i) improve Monsenso&rsquo;s products and services through continued research and development; (ii) demonstrate, document, and publish the effectiveness of personal health technology for mental health; (iii) health research into clinical evidence for treatment and care of mental health.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To present your data to you: </strong>The data produced are displayed through our services.

Monsenso applies anonymization through randomisation, which according to &ldquo;Opinion 05/2014 on Anonymization Techniques&rdquo; from the EU Data Protection Working Party Article 29 chapter, is an anonymization technique that alters the veracity of the data in order to remove the strong link between the data and the individual. </p>\n\n<h3>8.
