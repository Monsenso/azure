# Create a new environment on Azure

1. [Have Sentia create the environment.](docs/create-environment.md)
2. [Create/generate a key](docs/keyvault-key-generation.md) named `data-protection` in the key vault.
3. [Run ./setup-secrets.](docs/setup-secrets.md)
4. [Run ./initialize-couchbase-cluster](docs/initialize-couchbase-cluster.md), with proper environment variables set (read the file for
   those available and their defaults).
5. Setup global bucket XDCR.
6. [Add a group](docs/couchbase-users-and-roles.md) to Couchbase called `services` with the
   Query CURL access role and the following
   roles on All buckets: Application Access, Data Reader, Data Writer, Data DCP Reader,
   Data Monitor, Views Reader, Query Select, Query Update, Query Insert, and Query Delete.
7. [Add a user](docs/couchbase-users-and-roles.md) to Couchbase called service-client with the
   password from the couchbasePassword secret in the key vault.
   couchbasePassword. And add the user to the services group.
8. [Modify Function app and app service ConfigurationÂ sections as needed.](docs/app-service-configuration.md)
9. [Deploy AzureFunctions](docs/deploy-services.md).
10. Run ./setup-secrets now; Skip this step if `systemFunctionsHostKey` is available in key vault already. This step is needed in case Function app secrets are not available until an app has been deployed.
11. Deploy the App Services.
12. [Add TLS certificate](docs/add-tls-certificate.md) to the key vault.
13. [Setup custom domains](docs/setup-custom-domains.md) for the IdentityServer and RestService App Services.
14. [Configure TLS](docs/configure-tls.md) for the IdentityServer and RestService App Services.
15. [Upload signing-cert.pfx and extra-valid-cert.pfx](docs/upload-identityserver-certificates.md) to the IdentityServer service. Temporarily enable ftps for the service to upload them over ftps.

# Couchbase cluster initialization
